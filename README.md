# libft

This repository holds a function library that I created for our school's libft-project. Our initial project required us to recreate some functions from the stdlib-library as well as some other ones specified by the subject. I will be updating this library with any new useful functions I create for other projects.

Functions have been written to conform to our school's Norm. This means for example that each function can be at max 25 lines long, can have at most 4 parameters and won't have more than 4 sub-function declarations on the same file.
